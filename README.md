# SpotProxy

SpotProxy is a censorship resistance system that uses cost-effective and high-churn cloud instances to maximize the circumvention utility of cloud-hosted proxies. To achieve this, SpotProxy designs a circumvention infrastructure that constantly searches for cheaper VMs and refreshes the fleet for anti-blocking. SpotProxy is currently compatible with Snowflake and Wireguard.

** This project is not finalized, and it is not production ready. We are currently preparing for an open-source release. Target date: USENIX Security 2024 conference date, i.e., August 16 2024.**

## Contributions

SpotProxy is merely a first step in tailoring cloud instances for circumvention. We welcome and value all contributions to the project! Our [paper's](https://www.cs-pk.com/sec24-spotproxy-final.pdf) future work section contains a list of potential feature expansions.
