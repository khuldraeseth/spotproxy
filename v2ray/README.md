# V2Ray in SpotProxy

## TODO

- speak the same protocol the controller speaks
- work with NAT
- respond to requests for usage reports
- figure out what to do for client auth
  - figure out how to send config to new proxy (in-memory structure + gRPC?)
- maybe streamline launch somehow (still liking docker compose)
